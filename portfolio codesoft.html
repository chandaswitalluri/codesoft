      <h3> PLANTING TRESS FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE BY 
        SAVING MOTHER EARTH FROM DANGER</h3>
      <p>Tree plantation is very necessary because trees provide oxygen to the environment and make the air quality better. If more trees are planted then the world's environment will become a safer place to live in  tree plantation also reduces pollution, thus making the life of future generations secure . The needs for tree plantation has become even greater these days because of the growing pollution in the environment tree plantation involves transplanting tree seedlings to forests and spread greenery around. Planting trees can increase the resilience of ecosystem, help minimize climate change effects, and buy people and government time to adapt to changing conditions. Planting native seedlings In ecologically appropriate areas can also counteract soil and biodiversity loss and improve human well being. Tree plantation can provide a wide range of benefits, includes improving the environment, providing habitat for wildlife, stabilizing  soil, preventing erosion, and sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. It also absorbs and store rainwater that helps reduce runoff and sediment deposit after the storms. Trees give off oxygen that we need to breathe. Trees reduce the amount of storm water runoff, which reduces erosion and pollution in our waterways and may reduce the effects of flooding. Many species of wildlife depend on trees for habitat.</p>
